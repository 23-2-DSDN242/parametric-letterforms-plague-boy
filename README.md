## MDDN 242 2024 Assignment 2

Typeface: Puzzling
Campbell Smith

My overall design is inspired by the bachaus moveent, I wanted to create a type that used limited shapes, linework, and colours. 

This basic design allowed me to focus on the interpolation element, whicch is more inspired by the introductory credits of monsters inc, I wanted to feature a simple and intertwining linework animation, with a more large colour block. The use of lerp colour in the exhibition section, allowed further variation in my interpolation.

If I were to redo this project, I'd add one for element or shape to the base, potentially a circle, which would allow an even more hypnotizing interpolation between shapes.
